# 0389 - Find the Difference (Easy)

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y" 
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Approach 1: Bit Manipulation&#x20;

Same idea as [0136 - Single Number (Easy)](../0100-0199/0136-single-number-easy.md).

Prerequisite:  You should understand properties of XOR.&#x20;

Let's have a quick review.&#x20;

* If we take XOR of a number and a zero, the result will be that number, i.e. $$a \oplus 0 = a$$.&#x20;
* If we take XOR of two same numbers, it will return 0, i.e. $$a \oplus a = 0$$.&#x20;
* If we take XOR of multiple numbers, the order doesn't affect the result, i.e. $$a \oplus b \oplus c = a \oplus c \oplus b$$.&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char ans = 0;
        for (auto x : s) ans ^= x;
        for (auto x : t) ans ^= x;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Approach 2: Hash Map

We can store the frequency for each character. As `t` has one more character, we can count `t` first, iterate `s` to subtract the occurrences. The answer will be the one which has one occurrence.&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        for (auto x : t) m[x]++;
        for (auto x : s) m[x]--;
        for (auto x : m) {
            if (x.second == 1) {
                return x.first;
            }
        }
        // returning any character would work as it never reaches here
        return 'a';
    }
};
```

## Approach 3: Sorting

We can sort both input and compare each character one by one. If there is a difference, then return  $$t[i]$$. Otherwise, return the last character of $$t$$ as the first $$len(s)$$characters are same.&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        sort(t.begin(), t.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != t[i]) {
                return t[i];
            }
        }
        return t.back();
    }
};
```
