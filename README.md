### Introduction

Speaking of LeetCode, most people solve LeetCode problems just because they want to get into FANG companies as they often ask candidates these programming problems during interviews. It is pretty sad to see that only minority of people solve problems just for fun or just for educational purposes.

### Target Audience

Programming Lovers!

### Who am I?

I was an ACMHK Collegiate Programming Contests Representative back in 2015. I've given up since then and picked up again in 2019.

I joined LeetCode in 2020. With constant practice, I would like to share my intuitions to guide some beginners and meet some people with similar interests to discuss. Logical thinking has been an important trait in Programming. I enjoy the process of thinking rather than the result. I mainly solve problems using C++ as this was the first programming language I learned. Sometime I would do it using Python, Go and maybe Rust.
